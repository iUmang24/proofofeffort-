# proofofeffort
The **Proof of Effort Token (POET)** is a blockchain-based reward system that incentivizes users based on the effort or time they spend on a particular task. Unlike traditional reward mechanisms that rely on financial investments or computational power (such as Proof of Work), this project focuses on rewarding individuals for their actual effort.

### **How It Works**  
Users can log their time spent on tasks by interacting with the smart contract. When a user submits their effort (measured in time), the contract calculates and distributes tokens as a reward. To prevent abuse, there is a minimum time interval between effort submissions.

### **Key Features**  
- **Effort-Based Rewarding**: Users earn tokens proportionally to their time spent.  
- **Fairness & Transparency**: The contract ensures that only legitimate efforts are rewarded.  
- **No Initial Supply**: New tokens are minted as users log their efforts.  
- **Abuse Prevention**: A time restriction prevents rapid or repeated submissions to manipulate the system.  

### **Use Cases**  
- **Education & Learning**: Reward students for studying or completing courses.  
- **Work & Productivity**: Encourage workers to track and improve their productivity.  
- **Fitness & Well-being**: Incentivize physical activities like exercise or meditation.  

This project provides a decentralized and fair method to recognize and reward individual contributions based on effort, making it applicable in various real-world scenarios. ðŸš€
